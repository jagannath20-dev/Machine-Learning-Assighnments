    "    \n",
    "    Most data can be categorized into 4 basic types from a Machine Learning perspective: Numerical Data, \n",
    "    Categorical Data, Time-Series Data, and Text data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Numerical Data  :\n",
    "    \n",
    "          Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call \n",
    "          numerical data, quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as \n",
    "          a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "\n",
    "         Numerical data can be characterized by continuous or discrete data. Continuous data can assume any \n",
    "         value within a range whereas discrete data has distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example :\n",
    "      \n",
    "      The number of students taking Python class would be a discrete data set. You can only have discrete whole \n",
    "      number values like 10, 25, or 33. A class cannot have 12.75 students enrolled. A student either join a class \n",
    "      or he doesn’t. On the other hand, continuous data are numbers that can fall anywhere within a range. Like \n",
    "      a student could have an average score of 88.25 which falls between 0 and 100.\n",
    "      The takeaway here is that numerical data is not ordered in time. They are just numbers that we have collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Data  :\n",
    "\n",
    "      Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. \n",
    "      Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for \n",
    "      blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take \n",
    "      the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "      In the context of super classification, categorical data would be the class label. This would also be \n",
    "      something like if a person is a man or woman, or property is residential or commercial.\n",
    "\n",
    "     There is also something called ordinal data, which in some sense is a mix of numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "     In ordinal data, the data still falls into categories, but those categories are ordered or ranked in \n",
    "     some particular way. An example would be class difficulty, such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. \n",
    "     Those three types of classes would be a way that we could label the classes, and they have a natural order \n",
    "     in increasing difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Data :\n",
    "\n",
    "     Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is \n",
    "     very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached \n",
    "     to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example :\n",
    "     \n",
    "     we might measure the average number of home sales for many years. The difference of time series data and\n",
    "     numerical data is that rather than having a bunch of numerical values that don’t have any time ordering, \n",
    "     time-series data does have some implied ordering. There is a first data point collected and the last data\n",
    "     point collected.\n",
    "Text  :\n",
    " \n",
    "     Text data is basically just words. A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it \n",
    "     into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation.\n",
    "     These are four types of data from a Machine Learning perspective. Depending on exactly the type of data, \n",
    "     this might have some repercussions for the type of algorithms that you can use for feature engineering \n",
    "     and modeling"
